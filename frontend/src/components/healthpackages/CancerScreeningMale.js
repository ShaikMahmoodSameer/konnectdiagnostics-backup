        <h3>What is the package for?</h3>
        <p>
          Konnect Cancer Screening - Male package is required for the early
          detection of cancer in males. This package is used to check for the
          presence of colon, prostate, lung, skin, oral cancer, etc. before the
          appearance of any symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regular screenings can help detect some cancer cells at an early stage
          when they are still small and have not spread. A delay in diagnosis
          causes the cancer to spread to various parts of the body, which makes
          treatment extremely difficult. If detected early, cancers such as
          testicular and prostate cancer can be completely treated.
        </p>
        <h3>Who should opt for this package?</h3>
        <p>

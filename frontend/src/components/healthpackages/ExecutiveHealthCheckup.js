        <h3>What is the package for? </h3>
        <p>
          Konnect Executive Health Checkup package helps to screen and monitor
          the risk of developing various conditions such as diabetes,
          hypertension, bone, kidney, and thyroid disorders. In todayâ€™s world,
          stressful lifestyles, erratic work schedules, sporadic mealtimes, and
          a lack of adequate physical activity, all have a significant negative
          influence on our health and well-being. Therefore, the concern for
          being healthy has been increasing dramatically. There is a need to
          undergo this package once a year, which will educate individuals on
          their overall well-being. Additionally, it can also help healthcare
          providers to provide early diagnosis and effective treatment plans for
          that particular condition.

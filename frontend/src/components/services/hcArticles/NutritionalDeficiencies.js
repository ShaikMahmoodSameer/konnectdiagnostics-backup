        <h3 className="question">What is nutritional deficiency?</h3>
        <p className="answer">
          Nutrients are crucial elements for growth and immunity. These
          nutrients are absorbed by the body from the food we eat and when this
          doesnâ€™t happen, nutritional deficiency occurs, which may have a huge
          impact on the overall health of a person. Vitamins, minerals, and some
          fatty acids constitute nutrients of the body that are easily available
          through diet. The lack of a healthy and balanced diet can be a
          prominent cause of nutritional deficiency.
